# Exercise 1

I picked Java for this exercise so the answers are based on it.
First point to discuss are some common steps in CI set up.When we talk about lifting in Java, we have a lot of different tools but the most common and popular are: Checkstyle,Lightrun,PMD, Uncrustify. Second step in CI set up is testing and when we think about tools that help in this step are: Junit,TestNG,Mockito,JBehave,Selenium amongst others. And finally the last step in CI set up is building and in this case are five tools that are the most popular, and there are: Apache Ant, Apache Maven, Gradle, Jenkins and CMake.
Second point to discuss is: What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? To answer this first we have to know that Jenkins is still the best option to set up CI/CD, but at present we have a lot of new alternatives that are gaining popularity between developers all around the world. Here are some alternatives: Spacelift,Gitlab CI, AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, Travis CI.
Last point to discuss is: What would be better between a self-hosted or cloud-based environment and why?The correct answer is a cloud-based environment because it works better in small projects. To justify this I want to emphasize three points: scalability, security and accessibility. Security because we don't have to depend on an IT department but the bad thing is that despite being very secure, our data is in the hands of a third party. Scalability is easily scalable for small growing businesses. And accessibility because it is easily accessible through web browsers or applications from anywhere in the world.
